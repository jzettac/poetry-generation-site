# NaPoGenMo 2021 

This is an entry for [NaPoGenMo 2021](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2021). It was (is?) very fun. It is definitely very silly. Strongly recommended to read the poems aloud dramatically -- it makes them sound _artistic_ (most of the time).

You can see and interact with it at TODO URL.

## tl;dr

This is basically a bunch of awesome and fun tools built by [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/), repackaged.
